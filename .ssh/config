# LogLevel DEBUG

# Github and Bitbucket distinguish users based on SSH key. I have multiple
# accounts on these services, so I have to ensure that SSH will use correct key
# when connecting (otherwise it will authenticate as a wrong user, who may not
# have access to a particular repo). This is achieved using aliases below (git
# is configured to connect using these aliases, see `url` sections in git
# config file).
# Note that without IdentitiesOnly SSH would try all keys present in the
# ssh-agent (including keys that will work but authenticate as the wrong user).
# What's worse, the order of the keys in agent is not deterministic.
