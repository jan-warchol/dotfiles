My configuration for bash, git etc.  You should probably start by viewing
[`this repo`](https://github.com/janek-warchol/sensible-dotfiles), which
contains a carefully selected, minimal setup that I believe will be useful
for everyone.



Installation
------------

Clone the repo and run the [installation script](.install-dotfiles.sh).
It will make a backup of your existing config files before installing new ones
(unless you run it with `--overwrite` option).

    git clone https://github.com/janek-warchol/my-dotfiles ~/.dotfiles.git
    ~/.dotfiles.git/.install-dotfiles.sh

You'll probably want to move some parts of your old configuration into
the new files.  For convenience, all `.sh` files from `.config/bash/` directory
will be automatically sourced by `.bashrc`.

Note that to manage this repo you have to use `dotfiles` command instead of `git`
(see [_Structure_](README.md#structure)).



Features
--------

- **git-aware [bash prompt](.config/bash/prompt.sh)** displaying repository status, like this:  
  `janek@janek ~/.dotfiles.git (master|REBASE-i 3/5)` - _very_ convenient!

- lots of git [aliases, settings](.config/git/config) and
  [shorthands](.config/bash/git-aliases.sh) - in particular:
  - `git trash` command for discarding changes safely,
  - informative and **pretty [logs](.config/git/config#L50)**,
  - more information in case of merge conflicts,
  - `git diff` that displays file renames correctly

- handy [shell aliases](.config/bash/aliases.sh) - did you know that
  - `grep` can highlight matches even when piped to `less`?
  - `ls` can group directories together, listing them above files?

- [safeguards](.config/bash/safeguards.sh) that you can use to protect yourself from
  some common mistakes (have you ever `rm`'ed wrong file and wanted to get it back?)

- cool bash [settings](.config/bash/settings.sh), for example:
  - case-insensitive autocompletion,
  - `cd` to a directory just by typing its name, autocorrect typos

- [autocompletion](.config/bash/autocompletion.sh) for some of the shell aliases.



Structure
---------

[Some](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
[people](http://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/)
keep their dotfiles in a special folder and symlink them to their `$HOME`.
[Others](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles)
turn their whole `$HOME` directory into a git repository.

I use a hybrid approach that takes the best of both worlds: `$HOME` _is_
my working directory, but the actual repository data is _not_ kept in `$HOME/.git` -
it can be in any directory you want (by default it's in the directory where
the repo was initially cloned).

Git will recognize that `$HOME` is a repository only if you call it like this:

    git --work-tree="$HOME" --git-dir="$HOME/.dotfiles.git"

(that's what the [`dotfiles`](.bashrc#L4) command does).

This design has the following advantages:
- there are no symlinks that could get broken by some other programs,
- dotfiles' `.gitignore` doesn't interfere with other repositories,
- if you accidentally run a git command in a wrong dir you won't mess everything up.

Credit for this idea goes to [Kyle Fuller]
(http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/organising-dotfiles-in-a-git-repository/).

Note that git is configured to ignore everything except hidden files in this
repository - see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) for details.
